# Wine-Quality
Predicting wine quality in R

Given chemical features of red and white wines, along with the quality ratings for each wine, can
quality be predicted by the chemical data? 

Red and white wine datasets were taken from the UC Irvine ML database
Final project for IST 687 Introduction to data science with R

### Project Outline
1. Show summary analysis of the wine datasets and understand what the chemical data means  
2.Exploratory data analysis looking for relationships between wine features  
3.Hypothesize which features will be the best predictors of quality  
4.Test the hypothesis with two ML algorithms  
5.Evaluate the models  
6.Conclusion and next steps
